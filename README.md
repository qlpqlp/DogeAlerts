# Doge Alerts

**Doge Alerts** is a decentralized, transparent community alert website where anyone can contribute via GitHub to maintain and update all alerts related to the Dogecoin ecosystem. Whether it's blockchain issues, wallet problems, or scams, **Doge Alerts** provides a platform for the community to stay informed.

## How to Use

To get started, follow these steps:

### 1. Install GitHub
If you don’t have GitHub installed, you can download it from [GitHub's official website](https://github.com/).

### 2. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/qlpqlp/DogeAlerts.git
```
## Set Up the Folder Structure

Inside the cloned repository, you'll need to set up the `alerts` folder with specific subfolders. If the `alerts` folder doesn't already exist, create it manually.

You should create the following folders:

- `blockchain` – Everything related to the Dogecoin blockchain.
- `community` – Everything related to Dogecoin community events, news, or notifications.
- `exchange` – Anything related to Dogecoin on an exchange.
- `scam` – All scams related to Dogecoin, such as tokens using the name "Doge" to deceive the community.
- `wallet` – Everything related to Dogecoin wallets.

Each of these main folders can have two subfolders for status:

- `active` – Posts that are still active, recent, or not yet concluded.
- `closed` – Posts that no longer need to be listed as active.

## Creating Alert Posts

For each alert, create a `.txt` file inside the appropriate folder (either under `active` or `closed`). The filename should be the title of the alert, and the content of the file should be the **full URL** where the news or alert is sourced from.

### Example:
- **File Name**: `Dogechain.info wallet shutdown.txt`
- **File Content**: `https://dogechain.info/wallet/`

## Create a Pull Request

Once you've added or updated the alerts, push your changes to your GitHub fork and create a pull request (PR) to the `main` branch of the original repository (`qlpqlp/DogeAlerts`). This PR will be reviewed by the community, and once approved and merged, it will become available to everyone on [DogeAlerts.com](https://dogealerts.com).
